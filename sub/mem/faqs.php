				<h4>What is Imalia?</h4>
				<p>Imalia is an innovative financial services business, providing a range of financial and insurance products and services tailored to suit the needs of women.  Practically, this means a business model focused on tailored products and services, customer service excellence, rapid service delivery, and ease of access.</p>
				<p>Imalia engages women in a way that no Australian bank or insurance company has done before by connecting them with the products and services they need, and providing education and advice as to why they need them.</p>
				<p>Credit unions and building societies often seek to differentiate themselves based on a customer-centric approach, seeking to maximise returns for members through competitive financial product pricing.  No credit union, however, is as focused as Imalia on the economic opportunity afforded by women, let alone redesigning their entire structures using a gender lens as a way to innovate their offerings.</p>
			
				<div class="hr blue"></div>
				
				<h4>Why Imalia?</h4>
				
				<p>The time is right for a new approach to financial and insurance services that leverages itself on what women want and need from a financial and insurance service provider. The vast majority of women surveyed by Boston Consulting Group strongly indicated they want a tailored approach to financial services. Women have distinct needs and expectations; they want their banks and insurance providers to understand who they are and what they want.</p>
				<p>There are high levels of disenchantment with banks and insurance providers, and perceived ‘old ways’ of doing things. Women’s wealth is growing, and projected to continue to grow; yet women are very clearly saying they are dissatisfied with current offerings.</p>
				<p>Imalia is not just about serving women. Although women are taking an increasingly important role in managing family money, the innovation that occurs when women’s needs are put front and centre of new product and service development will work for everyone.</p>
				
				<div class="hr blue"></div>
				
				<h4>What can I expect from Imalia?</h4>
				<p>Our research shows that women want their financial and insurance providers to offer:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Products and services that streamline her llfe, ease stress and that meet her unique needs</li>
					<li>Vendors that understand her experience of life and her aspirations</li>
					<li>Transparent, accessible, easily-understood information, with helpful online tools to research and compare products</li>
					<li>Products that recognise women’s life-stages, with low-cost entry options that can be scaled to reflect changing needs throughout her lifetime.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<div class="hr blue"></div>
				
				<h4>What charitable causes does Imalia support?</h4>
				<p>The Imalia Fund is a sub-fund of Sydney Women’s Fund created to support women’s projects in the Greater Sydney area. Imalia also supports Shine for Kids and the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway.</p>
				
				<div class="hr blue"></div>
